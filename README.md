# BEST Kyiv Website

## Getting started
1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/)
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm start` and go to http://localhost:3000

To buld ejs into html run `npm run build`  
Also in development mode with constant reassembly when template changes `npm run dev`

## Templates and internationalization
As a template engine we use [EJS](https://ejs.co).
Therefore, only .ejs files must be edited. Do not edit .html manually.
